<h1 id="Test"><a href="#Test" class="headerlink" title="Test"></a>Test</h1><h2 id="Test-1"><a href="#Test-1" class="headerlink" title="Test"></a>Test</h2><h3 id="Test-2"><a href="#Test-2" class="headerlink" title="Test"></a>Test</h3><h4 id="Test-3"><a href="#Test-3" class="headerlink" title="Test"></a>Test</h4><h5 id="Test-4"><a href="#Test-4" class="headerlink" title="Test"></a>Test</h5><p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—<br>“‘Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>        Only this and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>        Nameless <em>here</em> for evermore.</p>
<p>And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain<br>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;<br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,<br>“‘Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—<br>Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—<br>        This it is and nothing more.”</p>
<p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,<br>“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;<br>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,<br>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,<br>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—<br>        Darkness there and nothing more.</p>
<p>Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,<br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;<br>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,<br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”<br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—<br>        Merely this and nothing more.</p>
<p>Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,<br>Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.<br>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;<br>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—<br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—<br>        ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”</p>
<p>Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,<br>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;<br>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;<br>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—<br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—<br>        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,<br>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,<br>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—<br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”<br>        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,<br>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;<br>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being<br>Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—<br>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,<br>        With such name as “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only<br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.<br>Nothing further then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—<br>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—<br>On the morrow <em>he</em> will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”<br>        Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,<br>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store<br>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster<br>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—<br>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore<br>        Of ‘Never—nevermore.’”</p>
<p>But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,<br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;<br>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking<br>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—<br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore<br>        Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing<br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;<br>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining<br>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,<br>But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,<br>        <em>She</em> shall press, ah, nevermore!</p>
<p>Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer<br>Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.<br>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee<br>Respite—respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore;<br>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”<br>        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—<br>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,<br>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—<br>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—<br>Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”<br>        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!<br>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—<br>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,<br>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”<br>        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>“Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—<br>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!<br>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!<br>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!<br>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”<br>        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</p>
<p>And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, <em>still</em> is sitting<br>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;<br>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,<br>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;<br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor<br>        Shall be lifted—nevermore!</p>
