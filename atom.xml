    <summary type="html">&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-center&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is referrible either to accident or intuition — that the work proceeded, step by step, to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;——Edgar Allan Poe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,&lt;br&gt;Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—&lt;br&gt;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,&lt;br&gt;As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;“‘Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;        Only this and nothing more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;&lt;br&gt;And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.&lt;br&gt;Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow&lt;br&gt;From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—&lt;br&gt;For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—&lt;br&gt;        Nameless &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; for evermore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain&lt;br&gt;Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;&lt;br&gt;So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,&lt;br&gt;“‘Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—&lt;br&gt;        This it is and nothing more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,&lt;br&gt;“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;&lt;br&gt;But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,&lt;br&gt;And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,&lt;br&gt;That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—&lt;br&gt;        Darkness there and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,&lt;br&gt;Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;&lt;br&gt;But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,&lt;br&gt;And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”&lt;br&gt;This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—&lt;br&gt;        Merely this and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,&lt;br&gt;Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.&lt;br&gt;“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;&lt;br&gt;Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—&lt;br&gt;Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—&lt;br&gt;        ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,&lt;br&gt;In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;&lt;br&gt;Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;&lt;br&gt;But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—&lt;br&gt;        Perched, and sat, and nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,&lt;br&gt;By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,&lt;br&gt;“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,&lt;br&gt;Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—&lt;br&gt;Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”&lt;br&gt;        Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,&lt;br&gt;Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;&lt;br&gt;For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being&lt;br&gt;Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door—&lt;br&gt;Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,&lt;br&gt;        With such name as “Nevermore.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
